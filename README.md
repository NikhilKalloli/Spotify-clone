# Spotify-clone
A Clone project to get experienced in using Vanilla CSS. I've tried to make it similar to original Spotify website.

## Installation
The only thing to install in this project is a vs code extension to host the website locally.
I would recommend "Live Server" for this project.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/NikhilKalloli/Spotify-clone.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Start the server:
With the help of above extension Launch the file named as ``` "index.html" ```
